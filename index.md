# Hi!

I am nef! 

I am 13 years old and live in germany.
I love coding applications in python. 
I have tried coding some UWP apps but i gave up and stuck to tkinter. i guess thats just not my thing.

Anyway, my best project is [txt2](https://github.com/not-nef/txt2)!

It is a cool text editor completely written in python! Basic features are implemented, but i am still actively working on it.

If you are interested in more fluent python apps, you should definetely check out [Futura-Py](https://github.com/Futura-Py)!
They make very cool apps!

yes thats kind of it.
Have a nice day!
